								<h2>Academic Journey</h2>
								<p>I started my educational journey at a language-focused high school, where I immersed myself in English, Spanish, and French. This not only shaped my linguistic skills but also my ability to adapt to different cultures and perspectives.</p>
								<p>I continued my studies with a Bachelor’s degree in Global Governance, an international and interdisciplinary program that opened my eyes to diverse fields like economics, politics, and technology. I specialized in Science and Technology, where I developed a keen interest in innovation and problem-solving.</p>
								<p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity. This exciting journey is helping me hone my skills in securing data and protecting digital infrastructures, aligning perfectly with my passion for creating a safer digital world where users can trust that their data is protected, their privacy is respected, and their online experiences remain secure.</p>
								<h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<p>When I’m not studying or working, you’ll find me indulging in the things that bring me joy. I love dancing — it’s my way of expressing myself and staying active. Painting and playing the piano let me explore my creative side, while traveling helps me recharge and find inspiration in new places. Most importantly, I treasure the time spent with my family, as they’re my biggest source of support and happiness.

My friends often call me “the wise one” because they know they can count on me for advice—I'm a great listener and always try to see things from others’ perspectives. I enjoy connecting with people and bringing positivity into any situation. </p>
